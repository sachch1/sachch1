# About Me

I work at the intersection of **security, cloud architecture,
and platform engineering**.

My background spans:
- Kubernetes & container security
- DevSecOps pipelines
- Infrastructure & network security
- Automation-first operations

I prefer **hands-on architecture** backed by
documentation, diagrams, and operational evidence.
