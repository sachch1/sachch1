## Secure Cloud-Native Architecture

I design platforms using a **security-first architecture lifecycle**:

**Design → Threat Model → Implement → Break → Secure → Operate**

### Reference Architecture: Secure Cloud-Native Platform

My primary work is captured in a living reference architecture:

**secure-cloud-native-architecture**

This repository demonstrates how to design and operate a
production-grade platform with real-world security constraints.

### Architecture Scope
- Kubernetes platform hardening
- Network isolation & Zero Trust access
- Secrets management & rotation
- GitOps-driven delivery
- Observability & incident response
- Compliance-aware design

### Architectural Artifacts
- High-level system architecture
- Trust boundaries & data flow diagrams
- STRIDE-based threat models
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
- Incident & chaos engineering scenarios

This work reflects how I would design platforms for
**banking, enterprise SaaS, or regulated cloud environments**.
