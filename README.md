# Sachchi — Security & Cloud-Native Architect

I design and secure **cloud-native platforms** for regulated,
high-risk, and production-critical environments.

My work focuses on **architecture decisions, threat modeling,
and operational security**, not just tooling.

## What I Do
- Secure Kubernetes & cloud-native platforms
- DevSecOps by design (CI/CD, supply chain, GitOps)
- Zero Trust & workload identity
- Incident-driven security architecture
